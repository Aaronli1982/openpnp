{"name":"OpenPnP","tagline":"Open Source SMD Pick and Place Hardware and Software","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nOpenPnP is a project to create the plans, prototype and software for a completely Open Source SMT pick and place machine that anyone can afford. I believe that with the ubiquity of cheap, precise motion control hardware, some ingenuity and plenty of Open Source software it should be possible to build and own a fully functional SMT pick and place machine for under $1000.\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\n\r\nOverall, the project is in a pre-alpha state. This means that it's under heavy development and there are currently no end-user usable components. We are working hard towards an initial alpha release.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\nOpenPnP is still under development. If you would like to keep up with our progress you can [Watch this project on GitHub](http://github.com/openpnp/openpnp), check out [our Twitter](http://twitter.com/openpnp), or [join the discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp).\r\n\r\n## Get Involved\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to be involved in the development of OpenPnP, please [join the discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp), introduce yourself and let us know how you can help. We are also active on Freenode IRC in the #openpnp channel. If you don't have an IRC client, you can [use this web based one](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openpnp).\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nMany thanks to ej-technologies for providing a complimentary license of install4j. install4j creates high quality, professional installers for Java applications.\r\n\r\nMore information at http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
